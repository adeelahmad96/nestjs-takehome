### Project Overview

"This project is a NestJS application where I implemented several tasks to showcase skills in RESTful API development, database management, message queue integration, and API optimization for performance and security. I designed each component with clean, modular code and a focus on best practices."

### Task 1: RESTful API with NestJS

"The first task was to set up a simple RESTful API with a `/users` endpoint. This endpoint supports two operations: adding a user (`POST /users`) and retrieving all users (`GET /users`). 

To achieve this:
1. I created a `User` entity in TypeORM with fields for `userId`, `name`, `email`, and `age`.
2. I configured a PostgreSQL database and used TypeORM to simplify database interactions and manage data models.
3. In the `UsersService`, I wrote functions to save a new user and retrieve all users. The controller then maps these functions to the `POST` and `GET` endpoints.

This setup demonstrates how to structure an API and separate logic between service and controller layers, keeping the code maintainable."

### Task 2: Database Schema and Optimization

"The second task focused on database schema design and optimization. The goal was to structure the database efficiently and ensure fast data retrieval.

1. I created the `User` entity as the schema in PostgreSQL with fields for `userId`, `name`, `email`, and `age`.
2. To optimize data retrieval, I wrote a query to retrieve users over the age of 18 and sort them by name. I also added indexes on `age` and `name` to speed up filtering and sorting.

I generated a migration to set up the `User` table with indexes. This approach ensures consistent database structure across environments and improves query performance, especially when dealing with large datasets."

### Task 3: Message Queue Integration

"The third task was to integrate a message queue with RabbitMQ to send a welcome message when a new user is added.

1. I installed RabbitMQ and set up a queue named `welcome_queue` for handling welcome messages.
2. In the `MessagingService`, I configured RabbitMQ to send messages when a user is created.
3. In `UsersService`, I integrated the messaging service to send a welcome message as soon as a new user is successfully saved to the database.

This demonstrates the use of asynchronous messaging to decouple services. Sending messages asynchronously means the user creation process doesn’t depend on the completion of the welcome message, which enhances system responsiveness and scalability."

### Task 4: API Performance and Security

"The final task focused on optimizing API performance and implementing security measures. I took the following approaches:

1. **Performance**:
   - I added caching (e.g., with Redis) for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
   - Implemented pagination on the `GET /users` endpoint to handle larger datasets efficiently.
   - Applied indexing on `age` and `name` in the database to speed up queries.

2. **Security**:
   - I used validation pipes to ensure all incoming data is in the correct format, preventing SQL Injection and XSS attacks.
   - Added rate limiting to protect endpoints from abuse, like brute-force attacks.
   - I designed the API to use JWT-based authentication for endpoints that need secure access.

These steps demonstrate my understanding of best practices in API performance and security, helping to create a robust and scalable API."

### Testing the Endpoints

"Once everything was set up, I tested the endpoints using `curl` and Postman to ensure the following:

- **POST /users**: Adds a new user with a JSON payload containing the user’s name, email, and age. If successful, it stores the user in the database and sends a welcome message through RabbitMQ.
- **GET /users**: Retrieves a list of all users, with pagination to handle large data sets.

Testing confirmed that the API meets all the task requirements and performs well under different scenarios."
